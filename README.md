# Portfolio Project

This is a material for a portfolio project class. showcasing a web application built with Streamlit for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Streamlit and FastAPI to create a full-stack web application. However, the primary purpose of this project is to showcase the construction of a portfolio for a data science practitioner with limited background in web development skills.
Streamlit is used for the frontend, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface, while FastAPI serves as the backend, handling Data Processing, Machine Learning, and serving RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Streamlit provides an interactive user interface with various widgets and components for data visualization and interaction.
- **RESTful API:** FastAPI serves as the backend API, providing endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Data Processing:** Backend handles data processing tasks efficiently, ensuring quick response times.
- **Machine Learning:** Incorporate machine learning models for prediction tasks.
- **Easy Deployment:** Both Streamlit and FastAPI are easy to deploy, making it simple to host the application on various platforms.
